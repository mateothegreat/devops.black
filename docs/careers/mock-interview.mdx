> "502 Bad Gateway" indicates that there is _something_ serving as a gateway that is proxying requests
> to the destination(s) and it is highly likely that it cannot reach them.
>
> It is important to find out where the failure is occurring. Is it the loadbalancer or is it that the
> service(s) have crashed or become unresponsive?
>
> Run a port scan using `nmap` to determine if the destination(s) are listening on port 80 and/or 443:
```bash
nmap -Pn -p80,443 "ip or hostname of destination"
```
>
> If you have access to the destination determine if the service(s) are listening on port 80 and/or 443:
