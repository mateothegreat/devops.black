## What is DevOps?

With the proliferation of software-as-a-service offerings has come a new
wave of tooling, technology, and business requirements. This has necessitated
that a new category be created to classify and address these concerns.

##### The text book definition:

> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.

##### The reality based definition:

> Management of the infrastructure and deployment lifecycle through automation, tooling, and technology selection.

No matter which way you slice it, DevOps has become a critical path in the
I.T. industry requiring that infrastructure and software engineering adapt
to ever-changing requirements in an agile fashion.

In this guide we will take you on the journey from novice engineering to
full-blown development operations through the operationalization and
productionization of infrastructure as code.

## Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle stretches from ideation all the way through productionization.
Throughout this process there may be owners of one or more categories.
